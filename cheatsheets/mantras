Negative emotions are a waste of energy

Don't give yourself a headache

Panicking does nothing to keep the plane in the sky

The angrier you are, the more marginalised you become

If you're not focused, you're wasting your time

The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they cannot tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good,and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, andpossessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.

Wastes
  Negative emotions
  Wishing things were different
